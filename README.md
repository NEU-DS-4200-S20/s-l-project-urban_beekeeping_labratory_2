**Under no circumstances should you be editing files via the GitHub user interface.** Do all your edits locally after cloning the repository.

1. In `README.md` update the URL above to point to your GitHub pages website.

1. `CD` or open a terminal / command prompt window into the cloned folder.

    * `python -m http.server 8000`
    * `python3 -m http.server 8000`
    * `py -m http.server 8000`
    If you are using Python 2 you will need to use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` instead, but please switch to Python 3 as [Python 2 will be sunset on 2020.01.01](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/).
