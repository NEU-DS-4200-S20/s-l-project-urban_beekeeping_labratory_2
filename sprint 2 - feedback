10/10 
- extremely slick interactions, amazing job! 
- I'm guessing you'll update the Bee Count info. 
- I really like the click for directions button and giving the choice to the user. 
Perhaps, move it before showing the vis. Otherwise the user play around with the vis and 
the vis might be in a different state. 
- I'm just pushing your team now: How hard is it to filter table information by date and link to the other vis?
