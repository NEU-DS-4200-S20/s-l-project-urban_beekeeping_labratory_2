- extremely slick interactions, amazing job! 
- I'm guessing you'll update the Bee Count info. 
- I really like the click for directions button and giving the choice to the user. 
Perhaps, move it before showing the vis. Otherwise the user play around with the vis and 
the vis might be in a different state. 
- I'm just pushing your team now: How hard is it to filter table information by date and link to the other vis?

I actually spoke to Prof. Cashman about it and we were thoroughly 
impressed by the work so far and decided to reward an extra credit. 
Your group should really participate in the S-L expo. More info
was posted on canvas, please take a look and let me know if you 
got any questions.
